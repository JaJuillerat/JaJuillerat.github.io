      <b>"Composite numbers that remain composite when inserting, replacing, or deleting a digit"</b>

    by Ian Fultz, Jacob Juillerat, and Aidan Kuster. There are two main lists to aid with following the constructions in the paper:
  </p>

  <p>(i) a list of positive integers <i>b</i> and the primes <i>p</i> for which the order of <i>10</i> modulo <i>p</i> is <i>b</i>, and</p>
  <p>(ii) a list that contains the covering systems presented in the tables in the paper.</p>

  <p>Details regarding these lists are written below.</p>

  <p>
    (i) a list of positive integers <i>b</i> and the primes <i>p</i> for which the order of <i>10</i> modulo <i>p</i> is <i>b</i>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each element of this list is itself a list of the form <i>[b,[p<sub>1</sub>,...,p<sub>t</sub>]]</I>. 
    The first entry <i>b</i> indicates that what follows is describing primes <i>p</i>
    for which the order of <i>10</i> modulo <i>p</i> is <i>b</i>. 
    The <i>b</i> correspond to the moduli used in the covering systems in the paper. If <i>p<sub>t-1</sub> = p<sub>t</sub></i>, then the numbers <i>p<sub>1</sub>,...,p<sub>t-2</sub></i> are distinct primes <i>p</i> 
    for which the order of <i>10</i> modulo <i>p</i> is <i>b</i>, and <i>p<sub>t-1</sub> = p<sub>t</sub></i> is a composite number 
    which is not a prime power and which is relatively prime to the product of the primes <i>p<sub>1</sub>,...,p<sub>t-2</sub></i>. Each prime divisor of <i>p<sub>t</sub></i> is such that the order of <i>10</i> modulo that prime is equal to <i>b</i>. 
    These primes are determined by factoring or partially factoring <i>Phi<sub>b</sub>(10)</I>, 
    where <i>Phi<sub>b</sub>(x)</i> is the <i>b</i>-th cyclotomic polynomial. The list <i>[b,[p<sub>1</sub>,...,p<sub>t</sub>]]</I> is indicating that there are at least <i>t</i> primes for which <i>10</i> has order <i>b</i> modulo <i>p</i>. 
  </p>


  <p>
   To reduce the overlap of data, this list only contains moduli that were not used in the paper "Consecutive primes which are widely digitally delicate". The list of positive integers <i>b</i> and the primes <i>p</i> for which the order of <i>10</i> modulo <i>p</i> is <i>b</i> used in the paper "Consecutive primes which are widely digitally delicate" can be found

  <p>(ii) a list that contains the covering systems presented in the tables in the paper.</p>

  <p>
    This is a series of lists for <I>x</I> in <I>{1, 3, 4, 6, 9}</I> and <I>d</I> in <I>{0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9}</I> of the form tablex[<I>x</I>] or tabled[<I>d</I>], respectively. Each list gives the information for the covering for the specified <I>x</I> or <I>d</I> value found in the tables in the paper. Each table is a list of the form <i>[a, b, p]</i> corresponding to the congruence <i>k = a (mod b)</I> where <i>p</i> is a prime 
    (or composite, but then <i>p</i> is associated with a prime divisor of this composite number) and <i>b</i> is the order of
    <i>10</i> modulo <i>p</i>. In other words, <i>p</i> appears in one of the lists in (i) above for <i>b</i>.  
    As above, <i>p</i> may appear twice (and hence <i>b</i> twice) if <i>p</i> is composite with at least two distinct prime factors. 
  </p>



  <p>
    If <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i> are two distinct prime factors of <i>p</i> in this case, then they are prime factors of 
    <i>Phi<sub>m</sub>(10)</I> which are relatively prime to <i>b</i> and hence <i>10</i> has order <i>b</i> modulo each of the primes <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>2</sub></i>. Thus, in the case that <i>p</i> is composite, the interpretation of <i>[a, b, p]</I> is that the congruence represented is 
    <i>k = a (mod b)</I> and the prime <i>p</i> is one of <i>q<sub>1</sub></i> and <i>q<sub>1</sub></i>, where each of these primes can be used with a different value of <i>a</i>.
